Submitted to Energy and AI", "summary": "Real-time energy forecasting on edge devices represents a major challenge for smart grid optimization and intelligent buildings. We present LAD-BNet (Lag-Aware Dual-Branch Network), an innovative neural architecture optimized for edge inference with Google Coral TPU. Our hybrid approach combines a branch dedicated to explicit exploitation of temporal lags with a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) featuring dilated convolutions, enabling simultaneous capture of short and long-term dependencies. Tested on real energy consumption data with 10-minute temporal resolution, LAD-BNet achieves 14.49% MAPE at 1-hour horizon with only 18ms inference time on Edge TPU, representing an 8-12 x acceleration compared to CPU. The multi-scale architecture enables predictions up to 12 hours with controlled performance degradation. Our model demonstrates a 2.39% improvement over LSTM baselines and 3.04% over pure TCN architectures, while maintaining a 180MB memory footprint suitable for embedded device constraints. These results pave the way for industrial applications in real-time energy optimization, demand management, and operational planning."}

Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods."}

Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a robot arm performing mechanical erasing tasks."}

Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities."}

However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/"}
