TL;DR: 该论文提出了RobustVLA方法，针对视觉-语言-动作模型的多模态扰动鲁棒性问题，通过离线鲁棒优化和输入一致性约束，在17种扰动下显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要关注简单的视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令、环境和观测等多模态扰动，导致在真实世界部署中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出RobustVLA方法：1）输出鲁棒性：通过离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况的动作噪声；2）输入鲁棒性：强制输入变化时保持动作一致性；3）将鲁棒性建模为多臂老虎机问题，使用上置信界算法识别最有害噪声。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，RobustVLA相比基线在pi0骨干上提升12.6%，在OpenVLA骨干上提升10.4%，推理速度比现有视觉鲁棒VLA快50.6倍，在混合扰动下提升10.4%。在真实FR5机器人上，四模态扰动下绝对增益达65.6%。

Conclusion: RobustVLA有效解决了VLA模型的多模态鲁棒性问题，在多种扰动条件下显著提升性能，特别适用于真实机器人部署场景。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

TL;DR: HiMAE是一种分层掩码自编码器，通过多分辨率嵌入来探索可穿戴传感器数据中不同时间尺度的重要性，在分类、回归和生成任务中优于现有方法，且能在智能手表上实现边缘推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器产生大量生理时间序列数据，但预测效用的原理尚不清楚。作者假设时间分辨率是表示学习的基本轴，不同临床和行为结果依赖于不同尺度的时间结构。

Method: 提出HiMAE（分层掩码自编码器）框架，结合掩码自编码与分层卷积编码器-解码器，生成多分辨率嵌入，将分辨率从超参数转变为可解释性探针。

Result: 在分类、回归和生成基准测试中，HiMAE始终优于忽略尺度信息的现有基础模型，同时模型规模小几个数量级，能在智能手表CPU上实现亚毫秒级推理。

Conclusion: HiMAE既是高效的自监督学习方法，也是发现可穿戴健康数据中尺度敏感结构的发现工具，支持真正的边缘推理。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

TL;DR: 本文研究了思维链监督对Transformer模型学习动态的影响，发现在符号推理任务中，思维链能加速泛化但无法克服更高算法复杂度的任务，并揭示了训练过程中存在暂时的推理轨迹不忠实阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链监督能显著提升Transformer性能，但模型如何学习遵循思维链并从中获益的机制尚不清楚。本文旨在通过符号推理任务研究这些学习动态。

Method: 在符号推理任务上预训练Transformer，通过可调算法复杂度和可控数据组成来研究泛化。设置两种训练模式：仅输出最终答案和输出思维链轨迹后回答。使用三参数逻辑曲线建模学习动态。

Result: 思维链能加速泛化但无法克服更高算法复杂度的任务；发现训练早期存在推理轨迹不忠实阶段；思维链改变了Transformer的内部计算机制。

Conclusion: 思维链监督通过改变内部计算机制来加速学习，但其效果受任务复杂度限制；推理轨迹忠实性是一个动态发展的特性；提出的动力学建模框架有助于理解Transformer学习过程。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

### [4] [Optimal Information Combining for Multi-Agent Systems Using Adaptive Bias Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25793)
*Siavash M. Alamouti,Fay Arjomandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来分析多智能体系统中的系统性偏差，引入了可学习性比率概念，并开发了ABLOC算法来学习偏差校正变换，证明了性能改进受限于可学习性比率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多智能体系统在环境条件变化时会遭受系统性偏差导致的性能下降，现有方法要么忽略偏差导致次优决策，要么需要昂贵的校准程序。

Method: 开发理论框架将偏差分解为可学习的系统性成分和不可约的随机成分，引入可学习性比率概念，提出ABLOC算法迭代学习偏差校正变换并优化组合权重。

Result: 实验验证显示高可学习性比率的系统能显著恢复性能（达到理论最大改进的40%-70%），而低可学习性系统获益甚微。

Conclusion: 可学习性比率决定了偏差学习是否值得投资，为系统设计者提供了量化指导，帮助决定何时投资偏差学习而非采用更简单的方法。

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,
validating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.

### [5] [Non-myopic Matching and Rebalancing in Large-Scale On-Demand Ride-Pooling Systems Using Simulation-Informed Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25796)
*Farnoosh Namdarpour,Joseph Y. J. Chow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于模拟的强化学习方法来解决拼车服务中的短视决策问题，通过将拼车模拟嵌入学习机制实现非短视决策，并提出了空闲车辆再平衡策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼车服务虽然能降低成本和环境影响，但其决策往往是短视的，忽视了调度决策的长期影响。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 将Xu等人(2018)的学习和规划框架从网约车扩展到拼车，在learning机制中嵌入拼车模拟以实现非短视决策，并提出空闲车辆再平衡策略，采用n步时间差分学习从模拟经验中学习时空状态值。

Result: 非短视匹配策略相比短视策略可将服务率提高8.4%，同时减少乘客车内等待时间；相比短视策略可减少25%以上车队规模而保持相同性能；结合再平衡操作可进一步减少等待时间27.3%、车内时间12.5%，提高服务率15.1%。

Conclusion: 提出的基于模拟的强化学习方法能有效解决拼车服务的短视决策问题，显著提高服务质量和运营效率，为运营商带来显著成本节约。

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

### [6] [MemEIC: A Step Toward Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25798)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemEIC是一种用于大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的持续组合知识编辑方法，通过混合外部-内部编辑器和双LoRA适配器实现视觉和文本知识的组合编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术通常只关注单一模态（视觉或语言）的编辑，忽视了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识更新的连续性，导致编辑效果不理想。

Method: 采用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含用于跨模态证据检索的双外部记忆和用于各模态解耦参数更新的双LoRA适配器，并引入受大脑启发的知识连接器进行组合推理。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升性能，并能有效保留先前的编辑结果。

Conclusion: MemEIC为LVLMs中的持续组合知识编辑设立了新的基准。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

### [7] [FreIE: Low-Frequency Spectral Bias in Neural Networks for Time-Series Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25800)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了时间序列预测中的频谱偏差现象，发现几乎所有主流模型都存在此现象，并提出FreLE算法通过频率正则化来缓解该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据的自相关性给多变量时间序列预测带来挑战，现有研究多将频谱偏差归因于特定模型架构，而非普遍现象。

Method: 通过大量实证实验测量主流模型的频谱偏差，并提出FreLE算法，通过显式和隐式频率正则化增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 实验证明几乎所有模型都存在频谱偏差现象，FreLE算法在大量实验中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 频谱偏差是时间序列预测模型的普遍特性，FreLE算法能有效缓解此问题并提升模型性能。

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at
https://github.com/Chenxing-Xuan/FreLE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出SPECS框架，通过自蒸馏生成偏好数据对，使用偏好训练而非监督微调进行冷启动，解耦多模态学习，在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于SFT的冷启动方法将推理范式与任务解决方案和输出格式交织，可能导致指令风格过拟合，削弱分布外泛化能力，并影响下游强化学习。

Method: 提出SPECS框架：(1)通过自蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；(2)进行基于偏好的训练，专注于浅层、可转移的表面形式标准；(3)将验证奖励的强化学习用于深度推理结果。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，SPECS框架相比强基线获得一致性能提升，MEGA-Bench提高4.1%，MathVista提高12.2%。

Conclusion: SPECS有助于减少分布内"卡顿"，改善探索，稳定训练，并提高性能上限，证明了基于偏好的冷启动方法的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESTO是一个利用软提示原像结构来优化黑盒大语言模型指令的框架，通过分数共享、原像初始化和分数一致性正则化，在相同查询预算下获得14倍评分数据，实现更高效的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒大语言模型因其强大性能被广泛使用，但内部参数不可访问。现有方法使用白盒LLM从优化软提示生成候选指令，但存在多对一映射导致的冗余查询问题。

Method: PRESTO框架包含三个核心组件：分数共享（与原像中所有软提示共享评估分数）、原像初始化（利用原像信息选择最大化搜索空间覆盖的初始数据点）、分数一致性正则化（强制每个原像内的预测一致性）。

Result: 在33个指令优化任务上的实验结果表明，PRESTO表现出优越性能，能够在相同查询预算下有效获得14倍多的评分数据。

Conclusion: PRESTO通过利用软提示的原像结构，将多对一映射重新解释为有用的先验知识，显著提高了黑盒LLM指令优化的效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在生成超出训练分辨率图像时性能下降，现有无需训练方法计算量大且不兼容Diffusion Transformer模型。

Method: 提出Neighborhood Patch Attention机制减少自注意力层计算冗余，集成到SDEdit流程中，引入Latent Frequency Mixing生成细节，应用Structure Guidance增强全局结构。

Result: 在U-Net和Diffusion Transformer架构上，ScaleDiff在图像质量和推理速度方面达到无需训练方法的最先进性能。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff是一个模型无关的高效框架，能够无需额外训练扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率，在质量和速度上表现优异。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: 提出的图拓扑方法有效解决了主动学习中的探索-利用权衡问题，在标签稀缺情况下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出在主动学习过程中使用任务驱动的表征，通过定期更新表征来改善对混乱数据池的处理效果，显著优于使用无监督或预训练表征的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的主动学习方法在处理混乱、未整理的数据池时效果有限，因为它们依赖于固定的无监督表征，这些表征可能无法捕捉与目标任务相关的重要信息。

Method: 提出两种任务驱动表征学习策略：一种是直接学习半监督表征，另一种是基于初始无监督表征进行监督微调。两种方法都在主动学习过程中定期使用已收集的标签更新表征。

Result: 两种策略都显著提高了在混乱数据池上的经验性能，优于使用无监督或预训练表征的方法。

Conclusion: 在主动学习过程中使用任务驱动的、定期更新的表征能够有效处理混乱数据池，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

TL;DR: MLT是一种可逆的确定性技术，用于将高基数分类标识符编码为紧凑数值向量，通过模运算和可逆线性变换保持双射映射，在保持完全可逆性的同时提供维度控制和计算可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统哈希或独热编码方法在处理高基数分类标识符时存在信息丢失或维度爆炸问题，需要一种既能保持双射映射又具有计算效率的编码方法。

Method: 利用有限域上的模运算和可逆线性变换，构建可逆的确定性编码方法，支持维度显式控制和计算可扩展性。

Result: 在MovieLens 20M数据集上的实验结果显示，MLT在预测性能上与监督嵌入方法相当，但需要更少的参数和更低的训练成本。

Conclusion: MLT提供了一种高效、可逆的高基数分类标识符编码方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种地理基础模型嵌入源在马拉维预测15项常规健康指标的表现，发现多源GeoFM整合模型在13/15指标上优于传统地理统计方法，为低收入和中等收入国家的健康信息系统提供了有效补充工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家的常规健康数据存在报告延迟和覆盖不全的问题，需要探索新的数据源和分析方法来提高数据可靠性。

Method: 使用XGBoost模型，基于552个健康服务区的数据，比较三种GeoFM嵌入源与传统地理插值方法的预测性能，采用80/20训练测试分割和5折交叉验证。

Result: 嵌入方法在15个指标中的13个优于基线方法，多源GeoFM模型表现最佳，在人口密度、新HIV病例和儿童疫苗接种等指标上取得较好预测效果，但对数据可用性低的目标预测效果差。

Conclusion: GeoFM嵌入为LMIC环境下的特定健康和人口结果提供了适度的预测改进，多源GeoFM整合是补充和加强受限常规健康信息系统的有效工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

*J. Jon Ryu,Pavan Yeddanapudi,Xiangxiang Xu,Gregory W. Wornell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文指出InfoNCE不应被视为有效的互信息估计器，提出了InfoNCE-anchor修改方法用于准确MI估计，并通过评分规则框架统一了多种对比学习目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管InfoNCE在对比表示学习中很受欢迎，但它与互信息的间接联系使其不适合作为有效的MI估计器，需要开发更准确的估计方法。

Method: 引入辅助锚点类进行一致的密度比估计，提出InfoNCE-anchor方法，并使用适当的评分规则框架统一各种对比学习目标。

Result: InfoNCE-anchor在log评分下实现了最准确的MI估计，但在自监督表示学习中，锚点并未改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 对比表示学习的优势不在于准确的MI估计本身，而在于学习结构化的密度比。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

TL;DR: 提出了INFEX框架，用于解决线性bandit中的稀疏探索问题，在保持理论性能的同时减少探索频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么需要持续探索（如UCB、Thompson Sampling），要么需要严格的多样性假设（如纯贪心方法），在安全关键或高成本领域存在局限性。

Method: 引入INFEX框架，按照预定调度执行基础探索策略，在探索间隔期间主要选择贪心动作。

Result: 理论分析表明，只要探索频率超过对数阈值，INFEX就能达到与标准高效算法相当的实例依赖遗憾。实证评估显示其具有最先进的遗憾性能和运行时改进。

Conclusion: INFEX是一个简单实用的通用框架，能够无缝集成任何完全自适应探索方法，在保持理论性能的同时提高计算效率。

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于离散时间生存分析的双重混合专家框架，结合特征编码MoE和风险MoE来建模患者异质性和时间动态，在乳腺癌数据集上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存分析需要同时建模患者异质性和时间动态，现有方法难以灵活整合这两个方面。

Method: 使用双重混合专家框架：特征编码MoE用于子群感知表示学习，风险MoE利用患者特征和时间嵌入捕捉时间动态。

Result: 在METABRIC和GBSG乳腺癌数据集上，时间依赖C指数提升高达0.04，与Consurv框架结合时获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: 双重MoE设计能够灵活整合到现有深度学习生存分析流程中，有效提升生存预测性能。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

TL;DR: 研究发现AI系统在象棋中表现出一个矛盾现象：早期层能较好编码人类战略概念，但深层虽然提升游戏表现却偏离人类思维，形成"异化智能"。通过Chess960测试发现模型依赖记忆模式而非抽象理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究AI系统是否真正理解人类概念还是仅仅模仿表面模式，通过象棋这一结合人类创造力和精确战略概念的领域来研究。

Method: 分析270M参数transformer模型，使用层间概念编码分析，并引入首个Chess960数据集（240个专家标注位置，涵盖6个战略概念）来测试概念鲁棒性。

Result: 早期层对人类概念编码准确率达85%，但深层降至50-65%；在消除开局理论的随机起始位置测试中，概念识别下降10-20%，显示模型依赖记忆模式。

Conclusion: 当前架构存在基本张力：赢得游戏的表征与人类思维表征相背离，AI系统在优化性能时发展出异化智能，这对需要真正人机协作的创造性AI应用构成挑战。

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Method: 在自然语言推理和图像分类任务上进行广泛实验，分析KD后模型的去偏能力变化，并识别导致不同行为的内部注意力模式和电路

Result: 发现KD会削弱模型的去偏能力，训练去偏模型不会从注入教师知识中受益，不同偏见的鲁棒性存在显著差异

Conclusion: 提出了三种有效解决方案来改善去偏方法的可蒸馏性，为理解KD工作原理和设计更好的去偏方法提供了见解

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Motivation: 符号回归旨在从观测数据中发现数学表达式，但深度学习符号回归中的缩放作用尚未被充分探索。受语言建模中缩放定律的启发，本文研究符号回归中的缩放规律。

Method: 使用可扩展的端到端Transformer流水线和精心生成的训练数据，在五个不同模型大小和三个数量级的计算量范围内进行系统研究。

Conclusion: 符号回归性能主要可通过计算量预测，这些结果为训练下一代符号回归模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

Method: 系统回顾2018年以来72项研究，分类分析合成金融信息的类型、生成方法和评估策略。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

Motivation: 传统基于补丁的bug二分查找方法存在多个显著障碍：假设bug引入提交和补丁提交修改相同函数、仅依赖代码变更而忽略提交消息中的漏洞信息、使用简单启发式方法缺乏逻辑分析

Method: 构建一个全面的多阶段流水线，利用LLMs：(1)充分利用补丁信息，(2)在上下文中比较多个候选提交，(3)通过一系列筛选步骤逐步缩小候选范围

Result: 评估显示该方法比最先进解决方案的准确率提高了38%以上，多阶段流水线相比基线LLM二分查找方法准确率提高了60%

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够突破现有解决方案的障碍，多阶段流水线对于准确识别bug引入提交至关重要

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

Conclusion: CorVS方法能够有效解决工业场景中的人员识别问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

Method: 开发SAFE工具包，整合多种数据域，按地理网格点的不同属性（领土、全球子区域、收入、土地覆盖）进行分层，分析每个属性层级的模型性能。

Result: 对多个最先进的AI天气预测模型进行基准测试，发现所有模型在每个属性上都表现出预测技能的差异，建立了基于不同提前时间和气候变量的模型预测公平性基准。

Conclusion: 通过超越全局平均指标，首次能够回答模型在哪些地方表现最佳或最差，以及哪些模型最公平的问题，为更全面的模型评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

Method: 提出LTE方法，通过提示LLMs其先前生成的错误答案和过长响应问题，无需外部专家指导，增强训练过程中的利用和探索能力。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，LTE在Qwen3-4B-Base模型上平均比GRPO在Pass@1上提升6.38，在Pass@k上提升9.00。分析确认LTE成功缓解了探索停滞问题。

Conclusion: LTE方法有效缓解了RLVR中的探索停滞问题，无需外部专家指导即可显著提升LLMs的推理能力，在数学推理任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

Conclusion: 子结构感知对齐在分子-文本学习中具有重要意义，MolBridge框架通过细粒度对齐显著提升了分子理解能力。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在工业时间序列异常检测中，简单的随机森林+XGBoost集成模型优于复杂的特征工程和混合架构方法，在高度不平衡和时间不确定的数据场景下，模型简洁性结合优化分割能提供更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估先进特征工程和混合模型架构在多元工业时间序列异常检测中的有效性，特别是针对蒸汽轮机系统，探索复杂方法是否比简单方法表现更好。

Method: 评估了变化点衍生的统计特征、基于聚类的子结构表示和混合学习策略对检测性能的影响，并与基于分割数据的随机森林+XGBoost集成模型进行比较。

Result: 复杂方法表现不佳，而简单集成模型实现了AUC-ROC 0.976、F1分数0.41，并在定义时间窗口内实现100%早期检测。

Conclusion: 在高度不平衡和时间不确定的数据场景中，模型简洁性结合优化分割可以超越更复杂的架构，提供更强的鲁棒性、可解释性和操作实用性。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了协作公共资源分配（CPRA）问题，考虑容量约束和时空动态，并开发了基于博弈论的时空强化学习框架GSTRL来解决这一NP难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共资源分配方法独立优化单个资源移动，未考虑容量约束，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 将CPRA问题建模为势博弈，证明势函数与最优目标无间隙，提出GSTRL框架捕捉系统时空动态。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明GSTRL具有优越性能。

Conclusion: GSTRL为CPRA问题提供了理论保证和实用解决方案，在真实场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

*Yunxiao Shi,Shuo Yang,Yixin Su,Rui Zhang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ACC-SGD-IE方法，通过跨训练传播留一扰动并更新累积影响状态，改进了标准SGD-IE在数据影响估计中的准确性，特别是在长训练周期下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代以数据为中心的AI需要精确的样本级影响估计。标准SGD-IE方法通过累加每轮替代项来近似留一影响，但忽略了跨轮次的复合效应，导致关键样本排序错误。

Method: 提出ACC-SGD-IE，一种轨迹感知估计器，在训练过程中传播留一扰动，并在每个步骤更新累积影响状态。

Result: 在平滑强凸设置中实现几何误差收缩，在平滑非凸机制中收紧误差界限；更大的小批量进一步减少常数。在Adult、20 Newsgroups和MNIST数据集上的实验表明，ACC-SGD-IE产生更准确的影响估计，特别是在长训练周期下。

Conclusion: 对于下游数据清洗，ACC-SGD-IE更可靠地标记噪声样本，使用ACC-SGD-IE清洗数据训练的模型优于使用SGD-IE清洗的模型。

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

TL;DR: 该研究使用机器学习方法分析健康索赔数据，识别预测医院再入院的关键因素，旨在降低再入院率并提高医疗质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低可预防的医院再入院率是支付方、提供者和政策制定者的国家优先事项，旨在改善医疗保健并降低成本。再入院率被用作评估医院医疗质量的基准。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和支持向量机等机器学习技术分析健康索赔数据，识别预测全因再入院的关键人口统计学和医疗因素。由于健康索赔数据维度高，采用主成分分析进行降维，并基于降维结果构建回归模型。

Result: 基于AUC指标评估比较模型性能，随机森林模型表现最佳，其次是逻辑回归和支持向量机模型。

Conclusion: 这些模型可用于识别导致再入院的关键因素，帮助确定需要重点关注的患者，从而降低再入院风险，最终降低医疗成本并提高医疗质量。

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Motivation: 由于微调大语言模型需要高昂的计算成本，测试时对齐方法受到关注。

Method: 基于采样模型预测控制和随机控制输入，在预logits层应用高斯扰动，通过重要性采样获得最优扰动均值。

Result: AISP在样本使用效率上优于最佳n采样，在奖励得分上优于其他基于奖励的测试时对齐方法。

Conclusion: AISP是一种有效的测试时对齐方法，能够在减少计算成本的同时实现更好的对齐效果。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的机器学习遗忘方法，通过将分类训练视为顺序学习过程，在模型末端添加投影重分布层来实现知识移除，无需访问原始数据集或完整模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法在现实部署中面临可扩展性问题，需要完整访问原始数据集和模型。本文旨在解决这些实际挑战，提供更实用的解决方案。

Method: 采用归纳方法，将分类训练视为顺序学习过程，通过反转最后训练序列实现遗忘。在模型末端添加投影重分布层作为输出过滤器，实现模块化和模型无关的部署。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10/100使用CNN模型，Covertype使用树模型）上的实验表明，该方法输出与完全重新训练模型相似，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在实际设置中展示了适用性、可扩展性和系统兼容性，同时保持了输出性能，为机器学习遗忘提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

*Hieu M. Vu,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Angular Steering方法，通过旋转激活向量在二维子空间内实现对大语言模型行为的精细控制，相比现有方法更稳定且参数选择更简单。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型行为控制方法（如向量加法、方向消融）局限于二维子空间，对参数敏感且可能影响无关特征，需要更灵活稳定的控制方法。

Method: Angular Steering将行为控制建模为几何旋转，在固定二维子空间内旋转激活向量朝向或远离目标行为方向；还提出Adaptive Angular Steering变体，仅旋转与目标特征对齐的激活。

Result: 在多个模型家族和尺寸上的实验表明，Angular Steering实现了稳健的行为控制，同时保持通用语言建模性能，相比现有方法具有更好的灵活性、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Angular Steering将现有加法和对齐技术统一到几何旋转框架下，简化了参数选择，在更广泛的调整范围内保持模型稳定性，为安全可靠AI部署提供了有效的行为控制方法。

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数生成模型缺乏对插值的主要概念，需要限制模型或数据维度的假设。本文旨在开发一种通用的插值方案，兼容不同度量和概率分布。

Method: 考虑类似于受限于合适数据分布的测地线的插值，并推导出一种无需额外训练即可计算这些曲线的新算法。

Result: 定量实验表明，该方法在多种模型和数据集上比基线方法更能穿越高密度区域。

Conclusion: 该方法在局部可被视为在合适的黎曼度量下的测地线，为生成模型提供了一种通用的插值方案。

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法将扩散模型视为黑盒精炼器，忽视了扩散生成过程中的内部分布转换，限制了效率。需要开发能够利用扩散过程内部机制的多目标优化方法。

Method: IMG算法在扩散生成过程中根据期望聚合多目标值进行加权重采样，确保生成样本符合期望的多目标玻尔兹曼分布。

Result: 在多目标分子生成任务中，IMG仅需单次生成就实现了比需要数百次扩散生成的基准优化算法显著更高的超体积。

Conclusion: IMG算法可视为优化的扩散过程，能够集成到现有方法中进一步提升性能，且多目标玻尔兹曼分布具有有趣的似然解释，是分布多目标优化问题的最优解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了离线偏好学习中的聚类问题，提出了两种算法：Off-C²PL用于纯离线设置，A²-Off-C²PL用于主动数据增强设置，解决了多用户偏好差异和离线数据不平衡的挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为离线偏好学习中的聚类问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过结合离线聚类和主动数据增强，能够更好地处理多用户偏好差异和数据不平衡问题。

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于token感知的因果表示学习框架，通过语言token的结构化因果模型来解释CLIP在组合推理上的失败原因，揭示了组合不可识别性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在跨模态泛化方面表现优异，但在对象、属性和关系的组合推理上持续失败，表现为类似词袋匹配器的行为。现有的因果解释通常将文本建模为单个向量，掩盖了token级别的结构，无法解释提示敏感性和硬负例失败等核心现象。

Method: 提出了基于token感知的因果表示学习框架，使用序列化语言token结构因果模型。理论证明了CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级和token级SCM下恢复模态不变潜在变量。

Result: token粒度分析首次从原理上解释了CLIP的组合脆弱性：组合不可识别性。证明了存在伪最优文本编码器，虽然实现了完美的模态不变对齐，但对原子概念的SWAP、REPLACE和ADD操作不敏感，无法区分正确标题和硬负例。

Conclusion: 分析通过模态间隙将语言侧不可识别性与视觉侧失败联系起来，展示了迭代组合操作如何加剧难度，为改进负例挖掘策略提供了动机。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习需要存储和重放历史数据，但在隐私安全约束下不可行。无数据持续学习通过模型反演生成数据，但面临计算效率低和特征偏移的挑战。

Method: 提出分层模型反演(PMI)来加速反演过程，并通过高斯分布和对比模型建模类特征，确保合成特征与真实特征对齐。

Result: 该方法在多个持续学习设置中表现出色，能够有效学习新类别并保持与历史知识的兼容性。

Conclusion: 结合PMI和特征建模的方法为无数据持续学习提供了高效可行的解决方案，特别适用于大型预训练模型如CLIP。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子退火在SVM训练中的应用潜力，探索QUBO编码精度对模型性能的影响，为量子计算在机器学习领域的应用提供实证依据。

Method: 将SVM训练转化为QUBO问题，使用量子退火进行模型优化，比较不同比特精度(如1比特/参数)的编码效果，并与经典LIBSVM求解器进行对比。

Result: 即使低精度QUBO编码(如1比特/参数)也能获得竞争性甚至更优的准确率；增加比特深度虽然允许更大的正则化参数，但并不总是改善分类性能；选择合适的支持向量可能比精确的权重更重要。

Conclusion: 虽然当前硬件限制了可求解QUBO问题的规模，但研究结果突显了量子退火在SVM训练中的潜力，随着量子设备规模扩大，这种方法有望实现高效的SVM训练。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合扩散模型和退火Langevin动力学的方法，在仅需L^4分数误差界的情况下实现多项式时间条件采样，改进了传统方法对MGF界的要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后验采样在图像修复、去模糊和MRI重建等任务中具有重要应用，但近似后验采样在计算上通常是难解的。现有方法如Langevin动力学对分数估计误差很敏感，需要更强的误差界条件。

Method: 针对局部或全局对数凹分布，将扩散模型与退火版本的Langevin动力学相结合，利用扩散模型在无条件设置中仅需L^2分数误差界的优势。

Result: 证明了该方法在多项式时间内实现条件采样，仅需要L^4分数误差界，相比传统方法要求的MGF界（次指数误差）条件更宽松。

Conclusion: 该方法为后验采样提供了一种更实用和高效的解决方案，降低了分数估计误差的要求，扩展了条件采样的应用范围。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

*Zhigao Guo,Feng Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的因果发现概念——干预约束，它不同于干预数据，而是以不等式约束形式编码高层次因果知识，确保学习到的模型符合已知的因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的因果发现方法虽然可以强制执行结构约束，但仍可能产生错误的因果结论。为了改进因果模型并提升下游任务性能，需要整合因果知识和机制。

Method: 提出了干预约束的概念，为线性因果模型量化总因果效应，并将其表述为约束优化问题，采用两阶段约束优化方法求解。

Result: 在真实数据集上的评估表明，整合干预约束不仅提高了模型准确性、确保与已有发现的一致性，还促进了原本难以识别的新因果关系的发现。

Conclusion: 干预约束填补了现有方法的空白，通过明确约束变量对之间的总因果效应，使学习模型能够尊重已知的因果影响，提高了模型的解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

Conclusion: 强化学习方法可以有效适应随机、非平稳和奖励稀疏的环境，为复杂应用场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

TL;DR: 开发基于流匹配的生成AI模型FM-Cast，用于高效、准确的平流层环流概率预报，在18次主要SSW事件中表现优异，计算效率远超传统数值天气预报系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平流层突然增温事件是次季节可预报性的关键来源和极端冬季天气的主要驱动因素，但传统数值天气预报系统在物理表示、初始化和计算需求方面存在局限，数据驱动方法在复杂三维SSW动力学中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 采用基于流匹配的生成AI模型FM-Cast，构建平流层环流时空演化的概率预报系统，通过理想化实验区分对流层强迫和内部平流层动力驱动的SSW事件。

Result: 在1998-2024年的18次主要SSW事件中，FM-Cast成功预报了10次事件的爆发、强度和形态，提前期达20天，集合准确率超过50%，性能媲美或优于领先的NWP系统，在消费级GPU上仅需2分钟完成50成员、30天的预报。

Conclusion: 建立了一个计算高效的平流层异常概率预报范式，展示了生成AI在深化大气-气候动力学物理理解方面的潜力，揭示了SSW可预报性与基本物理驱动因素的根本联系。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep
learning dominates recent MTL research, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin
SVMs (TWSVMs) remain relevant due to their interpretability, theoretical rigor,
and effectiveness with small datasets.
  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting
shared representations, task regularization, and structural coupling
strategies. Special attention is given to emerging TWSVM extensions for
multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare
these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and
empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer
vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building
scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks. This work
provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested
in SVM- and TWSVM-based multi-task learning.

Motivation: 现有方法采用两阶段训练潜在动作模型和世界模型，导致训练冗余且限制了协同适应潜力。直接联合训练虽然概念简单但容易导致表示坍塌。

Method: 提出CoLA-World框架，通过关键预热阶段有效对齐从零开始训练的潜在动作模型与预训练世界模型的表示，然后进行联合训练，实现两者的协同进化。

Conclusion: CoLA-World成功实现了潜在动作模型与世界模型的联合训练，解决了核心的表示对齐挑战，为领域建立了新的训练范式。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Result: 大量实验表明，MRGC在各种攻击场景下都表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过流形约束方法可以有效提高图压缩的鲁棒性，在对抗攻击下保持压缩图的分类复杂度降低能力。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

TL;DR: ReSpec系统通过动态调整推测解码配置、通过知识蒸馏演进草稿模型以及按奖励加权更新，解决了将推测解码集成到强化学习训练中的三个关键问题，在Qwen模型上实现了最高4.5倍的加速，同时保持奖励收敛和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过强化学习进行适应时，生成阶段通常消耗超过75%的训练时间。推测解码在服务系统中加速自回归生成，但其在强化学习训练中的行为尚未充分探索，存在三个关键障碍阻碍其集成。

Method: 提出ReSpec系统，包含三个互补机制：动态调整推测解码配置、通过知识蒸馏演进草稿模型、按rollout奖励加权更新。

Result: 在Qwen模型（3B-14B）上，ReSpec实现了最高4.5倍的加速，同时保持了奖励收敛和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ReSpec为基于强化学习的高效LLM适应提供了一个实用解决方案，成功解决了推测解码在强化学习系统中的集成挑战。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于影响函数的数据选择方法CROPI，用于提升大型语言模型在可验证奖励强化学习中的训练效率。该方法通过离线轨迹近似估计数据影响力，并利用稀疏随机投影降低梯度维度，实现多阶段课程学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR中的数据选择方法主要基于启发式，缺乏理论保证和泛化性。需要一种理论支撑的方法来估计每个数据点对学习目标的贡献，以提高训练效率。

Method: 提出CROPI框架：1）使用影响函数理论估计数据影响力；2）开发离线策略影响估计方法，避免昂贵的策略rollout；3）采用稀疏随机投影降低LLM高维梯度；4）构建多阶段RL框架迭代选择最有影响力的数据。

Result: 在7B参数模型上的实验表明，CROPI显著加速训练。在1.5B模型上，仅使用每阶段10%的数据就实现了2.66倍的步级加速，相比全数据集训练。

Conclusion: 基于影响函数的数据选择在高效RLVR中具有巨大潜力，CROPI框架为理论驱动的数据选择提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在资源受限的可穿戴设备上，通过无监督异常检测（UAD）作为上游过滤机制来提升心电图（ECG）分析的鲁棒性。通过神经架构搜索优化六种UAD方法，在严格参数限制下（最多512k参数），Deep SVDD在检测性能和效率间取得最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备的连续ECG监测对早期心血管疾病检测有重要意义，但资源受限环境中的深度学习模型面临分布外（OOD）数据的可靠性挑战。OOD输入会导致错误的高置信度预测，危及患者安全。现有方法要么忽略计算约束，要么分别处理噪声和未见类别。

Method: 使用神经架构搜索（NAS）在严格资源约束下优化六种无监督异常检测方法：Deep SVDD、基于重构的模型、掩码异常检测、归一化流和扩散模型。在PTB-XL和BUT QDB数据集上评估OOD心血管疾病类别和噪声污染信号的检测能力。

Result: Deep SVDD在检测性能和效率之间始终达到最佳平衡。在实际部署模拟中，将优化的Deep SVDD过滤器与诊断分类器集成，相比仅使用分类器的基线，准确率提高了高达21个百分点。

Conclusion: 研究表明，优化的UAD过滤器可以保护自动ECG分析，使可穿戴设备上的连续心血管监测更加安全和可靠。

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

Motivation: 模型和超参数选择在机器学习中至关重要但具有挑战性，通常需要专家直觉或昂贵的自动搜索。本文旨在探索LLM是否可以作为上下文元学习器来完成这一任务。

Method: 将每个数据集转换为可解释的元数据，使用两种提示策略：(1) 零样本模式仅依赖预训练知识，(2) 元信息模式通过过去任务的模型性能示例进行增强。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LLM能够利用数据集元数据推荐有竞争力的模型和超参数，无需搜索，元信息提示的改进展示了LLM在上下文元学习中的能力。

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

Conclusion: ICPO为LRMs揭示了一个可扩展且有效的RLVR范式。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

Motivation: 在计算受限的IoT设备上部署机器学习模型是现代应用的关键需求，需要轻量级模型来减少内存占用和能源消耗。

Method: 采用训练过程中奖励特征和阈值重用的技术，结合改进的训练过程和替代内存布局，来构建紧凑的提升决策树集成模型。

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了几何正则化世界模型（GRWM），通过在潜在表示空间中强制连续观测点保持几何邻近性，显著改善了世界模型的长期预测性能，而无需扩大动态模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型在长期预测中表现脆弱且性能下降，主要原因在于表示质量不足——高维外部感知输入导致潜在表示存在信息损失或纠缠，使得动态学习变得困难。

Method: 提出GRWM方法，在自然感官轨迹上强制连续点在潜在表示空间中保持几何邻近性，该方法即插即用，仅需最小架构修改，与多种潜在生成主干兼容。

Result: 在确定性3D环境和长期预测任务中，GRWM显著提高了rollout保真度和稳定性，学习到的潜在流形具有更优的几何结构。

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的直接有效途径，能够在不扩大动态模块的情况下实现可靠的长期预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Bernstein基参数化和Wasserstein距离最小化的分布回归方法，通过高斯分量建模条件分布，在保持几何准确性和可解释性的同时提供计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布回归方法要么忽略概率空间的几何结构，要么计算成本高昂。本文旨在克服这些限制，开发一个既考虑分布几何特性又计算实用的方法。

Method: 使用Bernstein多项式构建输入变量的函数来参数化高斯分量的均值和协方差，从而建模平滑概率轨迹。损失函数采用预测高斯分布与经验数据之间的平均平方Wasserstein距离，并通过自动微分优化训练模型。

Result: 在包含复杂轨迹的合成数据集上实验表明，该方法在Wasserstein距离、能量距离和RMSE指标上具有竞争力的近似质量，特别是在非线性明显的情况下。模型轨迹平滑度优于或可与替代方法相媲美，对数据结构变化具有鲁棒性，且通过控制点参数化保持高可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法代表了几何准确性、计算实用性和可解释性的平衡解决方案。未来研究方向包括扩展到非高斯分布、应用熵正则化加速计算，以及适应高维数据以逼近曲面和更复杂结构。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Motivation: 现有建模方法基于最小作用原理，只能学习梯度场动力学，无法捕捉真实世界中许多系统（如单细胞RNA细胞周期）的非梯度周期性行为。

Method: 通过设计和求解具有非零漂移参考过程的薛定谔桥问题，利用推断的速度和群体快照数据来学习非梯度场动力学。

Conclusion: Curly-FM将流匹配模型扩展到超越群体建模，能够建模物理系统中已知的周期性行为，为自然过程动力学建模提供了新方法。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

Motivation: 重新审视在差分隐私下计算矩阵前r个奇异向量张成子空间的任务，解决Hardt和Roth提出的问题，旨在开发更有效的私有算法。

Method: 基于奇异值分解和标准扰动机制的简单高效算法，利用秩r相干性和谱间隙来构建私有秩r近似。

Result: 提出的算法在密集设置下实现了与最优非私有算法相同的单峰PCA保证，而先前的私有算法未能做到。同时证明了秩r相干性在高斯扰动下不会增加。

Conclusion: 该算法在差分隐私下有效计算奇异向量子空间，解决了重要理论问题，并在多个应用场景中表现出优越性能，包括图问题中的最大割问题。

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然单个LoRA适配器很轻量，但在实际场景中同时加载多个适配器时，其总成本会变得很高，需要一种高效的量化方法来减少存储需求。

Method: 使用奇异值分解(SVD)对每个适配器进行重参数化，将最重要的信息集中在特定行列，然后对重要部分使用高精度量化，其余部分使用超低位宽量化。

Result: 在LLaMA 2-7B、LLaMA 2-13B和Mistral 7B模型上的数学推理、编码和摘要任务实验表明，LoRAQuant使用的比特数显著低于其他量化方法，但性能相当甚至更好。

Conclusion: LoRAQuant是一种有效的LoRA适配器量化方法，能够在显著降低存储需求的同时保持或提升模型性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Motivation: 标准延迟算法训练需要为每个训练实例查询所有专家，这在专家查询成本高昂时变得不可行，违背了延迟的核心目标。

Method: 为两阶段和单阶段多专家延迟设置提出了新算法，选择性查询训练示例的专家子集，并建立了理论保证包括泛化边界和标签复杂度分析。

Result: 在多个领域的实证结果显示，算法显著降低了训练成本而不牺牲预测准确性。

Conclusion: 预算感知延迟算法具有实际价值，能够在保持预测性能的同时有效控制训练成本。

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案，结合了Rand-K的鲁棒性和Top-K的强性能，有效缓解大规模分布式机器学习中的通信瓶颈。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical

also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对比了序列建模中参数化记忆的关联视图与几何视图，发现Transformer模型能够合成自己的原子事实几何结构，将复杂的推理任务简化为易于学习的几何任务，这种几何结构源于自然产生的谱偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究序列建模中参数化记忆的本质，挑战传统的关联视图（将记忆视为实体共现的暴力查找），探索几何视图如何更好地解释模型如何编码全局实体关系。

Method: 通过分离一个可分析的Transformer推理实例，分析模型如何合成原子事实的几何结构；通过分析Node2Vec的连接，证明几何结构源于自然产生的谱偏置。

Result: 发现Transformer模型能够合成自己的几何结构，将复杂的ℓ重组合推理任务简化为易于学习的1步几何任务；证明几何结构源于自然产生的谱偏置，而非典型的架构或优化压力。

Conclusion: 几何视图为参数化记忆提供了新的理解框架，鼓励研究人员在知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域重新审视默认直觉，并指出了使Transformer记忆更加几何化的改进空间。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

TL;DR: 提出STaMP量化方法，通过在序列维度应用线性变换并保持少量高精度token，显著改善低比特激活量化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量化方法在激活量化低于8比特时精度急剧下降，需要新方法来维持模型精度。

Method: STaMP量化在序列维度应用线性变换，利用语言和视觉数据的强局部相关性，同时保持少量token使用高精度。

Result: 在LVM和LLM架构上评估，STaMP显著改善了低比特激活量化，并与现有量化方法互补。

Conclusion: STaMP量化是一种有效的激活量化策略，能够维持模型精度同时降低平均激活比特宽度。

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Motivation: 传统影响函数计算需要整个数据集的Hessian矩阵，计算资源消耗大。随机采样方法虽然可行但估计结果高度不一致，需要更有效的采样策略。

Method: 提出了基于特征和logits的两种采样器，通过考虑特征或logits的随机分布来选择具有代表性的数据子集，从而提高影响函数估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的采样技术能够有效改进影响函数估计，在保持推理一致性的同时显著降低计算资源需求。

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Result: 最佳预测模型在分类准确率上达到或超过了专门为分类预训练的最先进模型，且预测性能与分类性能呈正相关。

Conclusion: 学习预测可能是构建通用时序基础模型的有效途径，挑战了任务特定预训练的必要性假设。

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型的强化学习微调中，BF16浮点精度会导致训练和推理策略之间的数值不匹配，而改用FP16可以解决这一问题，带来更稳定的优化、更快的收敛和更强的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习微调大型语言模型时因浮点精度导致的训练与推理策略不匹配问题，该问题导致优化不稳定。

Method: 将浮点精度从BF16改为FP16，这是一个简单的代码修改，无需改变模型架构或学习算法。

Result: 使用FP16统一精度能够实现更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，并在不同任务、算法和框架中表现出更强的性能。

Conclusion: FP16比BF16更适合用于强化学习微调，建议重新考虑精度权衡问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer模型学习排列同余生成器（PCGs）序列的能力，展示了Transformer能够在未见过的PCG变体序列上进行上下文预测，甚至当输出被截断为单个比特时也能可靠预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer模型是否能够学习PCGs这类复杂的伪随机数生成器序列，PCGs通过比特移位、异或、旋转和截断等操作增加了比线性同余生成器更大的难度。

Method: 使用最多5000万参数和50亿令牌的数据集，在模数高达2^22的范围内进行实验，训练模型预测PCG序列，并分析嵌入层和缩放规律。

Result: Transformer能够成功预测不同PCG变体的序列，发现预测所需的上下文序列元素数量随模数m的平方根增长，对于大模数需要结合小模数的训练数据进行课程学习。

Conclusion: Transformer能够学习复杂的PCG序列，揭示了模型自发将整数输入分组为比特旋转不变簇的现象，展示了表示从较小模数到较大模数的迁移能力。

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

Motivation: 现实世界中的机器人导航系统需要对环境有语义理解才能确定安全动作，因此需要开发能够感知风险的安全表示方法。

Method: 采用两步法：首先通过泊松方程的Dirichlet问题生成安全函数，然后通过拉普拉斯方程的Dirichlet问题合成安全引导场，两者结合定义安全约束并合成风险感知安全过滤器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过数学建模环境语义和风险级别，能够保证机器人导航的安全性，同时优先规避高风险障碍物，为风险感知的安全导航提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic
understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This
work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --
specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To
this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the
environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance
fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to
generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.
We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to
synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of
caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The
safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety
constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a
semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of
environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of
higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how
\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated
into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.

Motivation: 传统四元数姿态控制方法存在两个主要问题：1）不能保证闭环系统存在唯一的平衡姿态误差四元数；2）当绕姿态误差欧拉轴的旋转误差超过π弧度时，比例控制效果会随着系统状态远离稳定平衡点而减弱。

Method: 开发了一种新的姿态控制律，更有效地利用姿态误差的欧拉轴角信息，通过构造严格的Lyapunov函数来证明闭环旋转系统的唯一平衡点具有一致渐近稳定性。

Result: 数值仿真和数十次实时翻滚恢复飞行测试表明，所提出的轴角方法在稳定时间方面优于高性能四元数控制器，实现了更优越的飞行性能。

Conclusion: 基于欧拉轴角的新型姿态控制方法能够保证闭环系统存在唯一平衡点，提供更灵活的控制能力，并在实际应用中表现出比传统四元数方法更快的稳定性能。

Abstract: Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has
been proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled
as rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this
approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium
attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the
attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control
effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of
the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude
control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle
information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater
flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two
different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict
Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique
equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly
asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and
performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and
executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.
These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed
axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that
obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of
stabilization time.

Conclusion: DARTS展示了更灵活、集成的实时交通事件检测系统的潜力，具有显著提高交通管理运营效率和响应能力的意义，特别是在偏远地区和资源受限环境中的可扩展性和成本效益。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art
single-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of

possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We
propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to
estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely
sparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly
onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of
the vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to
maximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the
radiation source, and even track a moving radiation source.

Abstract: While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen
significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and
overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly
apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms
struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is
important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe
autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful
opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised
physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate
overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.
This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning
to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and
reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against
opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results
demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate
overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent
trained just to race.

Abstract: Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans
perceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different
levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,
extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories
into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view
videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),
or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we
triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and
uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and
qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not
linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in
eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,
elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and
guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots
compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as
anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments
of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance
proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader
societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not
dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering
critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TAMP方法在长时域问题中因过度运动采样而成本高昂，LLM虽然提供常识先验但缺乏3D空间推理能力，无法确保几何或动力学可行性。

Method: 基于混合状态树统一表示符号和数值状态，使用现成运动规划器和物理模拟器验证动力学约束，通过VLM基于状态视觉渲染引导TAMP解决方案探索和回溯搜索。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界实验中，相比传统和基于LLM的TAMP规划器，平均成功率提高32.14%-1166.67%，复杂问题规划时间减少。

Conclusion: 该框架通过混合状态表示和VLM引导，有效解决了TAMP中的运动采样效率和空间推理问题，在复杂任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning with
low-level motion feasibility, but existing methods are costly in long-horizon
problems due to excessive motion sampling. While LLMs provide commonsense
priors, they lack 3D spatial reasoning and cannot ensure geometric or dynamic
feasibility. We propose a kinodynamic TAMP framework based on a hybrid state
tree that uniformly represents symbolic and numeric states during planning,
enabling task and motion decisions to be jointly decided. Kinodynamic
constraints embedded in the TAMP problem are verified by an off-the-shelf
motion planner and physics simulator, and a VLM guides exploring a TAMP
solution and backtracks the search based on visual rendering of the states.
Experiments on the simulated domains and in the real world show 32.14% -
1166.67% increased average success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based
TAMP planners and reduced planning time on complex problems, with ablations
further highlighting the benefits of VLM guidance.

Abstract: Trajectory planning for mobile robots in cluttered environments remains a
major challenge due to narrow passages, where conventional methods often fail
or generate suboptimal paths. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive
trajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to
ensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision
test is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively
subdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee
pose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line
search is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free
and maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x
faster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, real-world
experiments confirm that the robot can safely pass through narrow passages
while maintaining rapid planning performance.

*Satoshi Kikuch,Masaya Kato,Tsuyoshi Tasaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CNN和Vision Transformer的新方法，用于在存在动态障碍物情况下的单目相机3D地图自定位，相比现有最佳方法在精度上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用廉价单目相机在3D地图上实现自定位是实现自动驾驶的关键需求。基于相机的自定位通常使用CNN提取局部特征，但当存在行人等动态障碍物时，CNN效果不佳。

Method: 将CNN与Vision Transformer相结合，CNN擅长提取局部特征，而Vision Transformer擅长提取全局特征，能够捕捉图像中所有patch之间的关系。

Result: 实验结果显示：在包含动态障碍物的CG数据集上，精度提升率比无动态障碍物时高1.5倍；在公共数据集上，自定位误差比现有最佳方法减少20.1%；机器人使用该方法平均定位误差为7.51cm，比现有最佳方法更精确。

Conclusion: 结合CNN和Vision Transformer的方法能够有效处理动态障碍物场景，显著提高单目相机3D地图自定位的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is
required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera
often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features
that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as
people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method
combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global
features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental
results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the
accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times
higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization
error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.
Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error
on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PHUMA是一个基于物理约束的人形机器人运动数据集，通过大规模人类视频数据解决现有方法中的物理伪影问题，在运动模仿和路径跟随任务中表现优于Humanoid-X和AMASS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动模仿方法依赖稀缺昂贵的运动捕捉数据，而基于互联网视频的方法存在物理伪影问题，限制了可扩展性和多样性。

Method: 通过数据筛选和物理约束重定向技术，强制执行关节限制、确保地面接触、消除脚部滑动，生成大规模且物理可靠的运动数据。

Result: 在未见运动模仿和仅骨盆引导的路径跟随任务中，PHUMA训练的策略显著优于Humanoid-X和AMASS，能够更好地模仿多样化运动。

Conclusion: PHUMA提供了一个大规模、物理可靠的人形机器人运动数据集，有效解决了现有方法的物理伪影问题，提升了运动模仿性能。

Abstract: Motion imitation is a promising approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling
agents to acquire humanlike behaviors. Existing methods typically rely on
high-quality motion capture datasets such as AMASS, but these are scarce and
expensive, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent studies attempt to scale
data collection by converting large-scale internet videos, exemplified by
Humanoid-X. However, they often introduce physical artifacts such as floating,
penetration, and foot skating, which hinder stable imitation. In response, we
introduce PHUMA, a Physically-grounded HUMAnoid locomotion dataset that
leverages human video at scale, while addressing physical artifacts through
careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. PHUMA enforces joint
limits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating, producing motions
that are both large-scale and physically reliable. We evaluated PHUMA in two
sets of conditions: (i) imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded test
videos and (ii) path following with pelvis-only guidance. In both cases,
PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS, achieving significant
gains in imitating diverse motions. The code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出Thor人形机器人框架，通过力自适应躯干倾斜奖励函数和解耦强化学习架构，实现接触丰富环境中的人级全身反应能力，在Unitree G1机器人上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使仿人机器人能够在接触丰富的环境中产生类似人类的适应性反应，同时保持全身稳定性，解决当前人形机器人在强烈接触交互任务中的挑战。

Method: 基于机器人力学分析设计力自适应躯干倾斜(FAT2)奖励函数；提出解耦强化学习架构，将上半身、腰部和下半身分开控制，共享全局观测并联合更新参数。

Result: 在Unitree G1机器人上，向后移动时峰值拉力达167.7N（约G1体重的48%），向前移动时145.5N，相比最佳基线分别提升68.9%和74.7%；能够拉动130N负载的货架和单手打开60N的防火门。

Conclusion: Thor框架有效提升了人形机器人的力交互能力，在接触丰富的环境中表现出类人的适应性反应，为服务、工业和救援应用提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue
applications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while
performing intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,
enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such
conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a
humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich
environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive
torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like
responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional
challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning
architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each
component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its
parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially
outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot
achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body
weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing
improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the
best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack
(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight
Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AgriGS-SLAM是一个结合视觉-LiDAR的SLAM框架，在果园环境中实现实时3D场景理解，通过多相机3D高斯泼溅渲染和LiDAR里程计耦合，在季节性变化和遮挡条件下提供稳定的重建和轨迹跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园环境中的自主机器人需要实时3D场景理解，但面临重复行几何、季节性外观变化和风驱动树叶运动等挑战，现有方法难以稳定处理这些复杂条件。

Method: 结合直接LiDAR里程计和闭环检测，使用多相机3D高斯泼溅渲染，通过批量栅格化互补视角恢复遮挡下的果园结构，采用统一梯度驱动地图生命周期管理来保留细节并控制内存。

Result: 在苹果和梨园的不同季节（休眠期、开花期、收获期）测试中，AgriGS-SLAM相比现有3DGS-SLAM基线方法提供更清晰、更稳定的重建和更平稳的轨迹，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在果园监测中表现出色，同时可应用于其他需要鲁棒多模态感知的户外领域。

Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and
steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while
maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard
monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
robust multimodal perception.

Motivation: 人类环境中的许多任务需要多个运动链的协作行为，但高自由度的复杂系统运动协调建模困难，需要一种能够直接对应单臂系统的抽象表示方法。

Method: 使用共形几何代数定义协作几何基元，基于这些基元的相似变换推导系统抽象表示，并导出解析和几何雅可比矩阵，集成到经典操作空间控制技术中。

Result: 在双手机器人、人形机器人和多指手的实验中验证了方法，包括达到期望几何基元的最优控制实验和使用微分运动学控制的遥操作实验。

Conclusion: 该工作为协作操作控制框架奠定了理论基础，几何基元自然地将零空间结构嵌入控制器，可用于引入次级控制目标，为未来应用提供了方向。

Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between
multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying
big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand
manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of
degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to
model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical
foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on
geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the
similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive
an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these
systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving
the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the
straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques
rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual
manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments
for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments
using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric
primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can
be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work,
represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control
framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while
giving pointers towards potential future applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人操作策略中应用广泛，但微调视觉-语言-动作模型时存在价值估计不准确和中间步骤监督稀疏的问题；模仿学习虽然易于训练但性能不足。

Method: Hi-ORS通过拒绝采样过滤负奖励样本稳定价值估计，采用奖励加权监督训练目标提供密集中间步骤监督，并开发异步推理训练框架支持在线人工干预。

Result: 在三个真实世界任务和两个具体实现中，Hi-ORS仅需1.5小时真实世界训练即可掌握接触丰富的操作任务，在效果和效率上大幅超越强化学习和模仿学习基线。

Conclusion: Hi-ORS方法实现了训练稳定性和高鲁棒性，微调后的策略展现出强大的测试时扩展能力，能够可靠执行复杂错误恢复行为以获得更好性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic
manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with
RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at
intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but
often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose
Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection
sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS
stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during
online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective
to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we
develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible
online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for
learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two
embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich
manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL
baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.
Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by
reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better
performance.

Conclusion: RoboOS-NeXT验证了其在实现终身、可扩展和鲁棒的多机器人协作方面的有效性。

Abstract: The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and
embodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,
scalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical
frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent
memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long
horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting
the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we
introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,
and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel
Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene
geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared
representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a
brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global
planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute
actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution
enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent
state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex
coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results
demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous
embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and
robust multi-robot collaboration. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人对自身运动学理解有限，只能执行预编程任务，难以有效利用工具。需要解决工具使用的四个关键要素：理解预期结果、选择合适工具、确定最佳工具方向、执行精确操作。

Method: 扩展机器人逆运动学求解器，集成仿真学习的动作轨迹与工具，使机器人能够获取使用不同长度工具的顺序动作库，实现从仿真到真实环境的技能迁移。

Conclusion: 该研究在工具使用的四个基本方面都取得了进展，使机器人能够掌握跨不同任务的复杂工具操作技能，展示了从仿真到真实环境技能迁移的可行性。

Abstract: Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and
are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools
efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the
desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool
orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering
framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse
kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions
using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action
trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired
skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive
experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver
demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our
trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our
model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two
distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of
potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool
usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across
diverse tasks.

Abstract: Stochastic state estimation methods for continuum robots (CRs) often struggle
to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While several recent works
have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to
simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic
representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the
speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in
continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to
addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline
operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for
continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a
filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all
while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first
stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction
for future research in this area.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that
combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with
a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller
for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and
sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a
practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance,
action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together
with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is
implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics,
including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning
efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show
improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines
(DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners, with better generalization to
unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes. Code and
evaluation scripts are available at the project repository.

Motivation: 现有的基于普通和随机去噪过程的扩散模仿学习方法难以同时实现快速采样和强多模态性能。

Method: HCP运行一个短随机前缀到自适应切换时间，然后应用一步一致性跳跃来生成最终动作。通过时间变化的一致性蒸馏，结合轨迹一致性目标保持相邻预测的连贯性和去噪匹配目标提高局部保真度。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人上，HCP仅需25步SDE加一次跳跃即可接近80步DDPM教师的准确性和模态覆盖度，同时显著降低延迟。

Conclusion: 多模态不需要慢推理，切换时间将模态保持与速度解耦，为机器人策略提供了实用的准确性与效率权衡。

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become
widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,
approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to
jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these
challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short
stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step
consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump
generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a
trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a
denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and
on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step
DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing
latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow
inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a
practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.

Abstract: In this paper, we show how to run pi0-level multi-view VLA at 30Hz frame rate
and at most 480Hz trajectory frequency using a single consumer GPU. This
enables dynamic and real-time tasks that were previously believed to be
unattainable by large VLA models. To achieve it, we introduce a bag of
strategies to eliminate the overheads in model inference. The real-world
